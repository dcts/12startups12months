## AI / LLM Apps
- **AI code tutor**: Interface for chatGPT that acts as a coding teacher (probably already implemented a hundred times by now).

- **AI Journal**: a personal diary automatically created for you. What did you do this day, adds automatically some images etc. Story about your day.
- Calories counter where you input the things you ate, ChatGPT puts it in a spreadsheet for you.
__Solution__: Speak to code! A simple webapp that lets you create a full codebase from scratch simply by talking to it. You start with an empty git repo, and each prompt will be transformed into a pull request, which you can accept, decline or modify.

## Ideas
- **Discord but without login: BurnerChat / BurnerSpaces**: Need discord or slack to communicate during an event but don't want to create a new workspace? BurnerSpaces can help. No login, no registration, just a simple url. The server is similar to slack or discord, but has the huge advantage that it can be run completely without login. Credentials are stored in the cookies / locally.
- **Quick-ToDo** or **Fast-ToDo**: create simple todo list on the desktop, then open on mobile by scanning as qr code. Lists are persistant for short time only (1-4 weeks maybe?). If you need a shareble todolist without the burden of downloading an app.
- **Decide-Now** or **quick-poll** or **fast-poll**: tired of group fatigue decision processes? Create a simple poll to help you and your group make a decision. Quick-Poll creator. Similar to: poll-maker.com. But with a bit different feature: => (1) no annonymous votes, (2) insert name and see who voted what (similar to doogle). Design inspos: Doodle, twitter polls, facebook polls.
- **GifStory**: create a story out of Gif's and add text, stickers and and emojis (similar to instagram functionality, maybe upload own images as well?). Allow for multiple pages (like a slideshow). Then make it easily shareable with a public link (expires in X days). PRO feature: pay 5$ per month: unlimited slides. Never expires. Templates.
- **ChooseMyStartup.com**: plattform that is a notebook for all your ideas and anyone can rate and comment them and signup if they would use it. Login through magic link. You can tag them. To find out what great ideas are. This allows you also to phrase your ideas and formulate them. Spend some time on evaluating them before presenting them to friends or strangers. PRO Features: add custom link: ChooseMyStartup.com/thomas + mobile version + Private Ideas.
- **launch your idea tracker**: Tool that aggregates all plattforms to promote a product launch (e.g. producthunt, sideproject.org and so on) and makes it easier to keep track of the process. a tool that keeps track of all your projects that you launch and all plattform where to launch in one place. Also generate metrics for the projects to measure success. Maybe code first to use for all other projects? Use the development cycle by 12 startups in 12 months guy
- **Encrypted Database**: Database as a service that lets you store your data. But we ensure that its encrypted. If you loose your keys, your data is not readible.
- **Podcastify**: Service for youtubers that automatically converts their videos and uploads them to Spotify!
- **CalledIt**: Service that lets you track predictions. (Idea by AllanHolmes how to implement MVP: notion doc that gets updated manually and people can submit their calls). Do MVP for "crypto youtubers predictions".
- **LetBezozPay**: Go to this site before buying stuff on amazon, and we will return all amazon affiliate income to a good cause. Idea by David. Nonprofit, simple to set up and get running.

- **take back your digital self**: Landing page that just has 1 cta: sign up if you want to own your own digital self. Lol. ANd ressources about why privacy matters. Why privacy != no accountability. Ressources to holochain and different sources. Cool youtube videos etc building the case for digital ownership of your data.

# Silly
- **cameo for celebrity doubles**: you would live a personal shoutout from a celebrity but cameo is too expensive? Worry not, we have top class celebrity doubles that are a quarter of the price that cameo.
- **publish your netflix series**: a fake neftlix website where you can upload your own videos and descriptions and share a public link with ur friends, so it looks like your fake content is an actual netflix series. To use as a joke only.
- **music NFT**: you are an artist. You create a single NFT that represents a song. Only the holder of this NFT can listen to your song. Then people can "line up" to purchase the NFT to listen to the song, and then sell it to the next person. When you buy, you know for sure that there is another person after you which will buy the piece to listen to. Smart contract ensures that you can buy and sell for the same price within a given amount of time. The last person keeps the NFT in perpituety. The nft is passed along, and every time the nft is changing "hands" the creator/artist gets a fee. The time you can hold and listen to the song is very limited. E.g. you line up and then you are assigned a specific time the NFT will be in your possesion and then you can play/listen the song. Flawed idea since when people will listen they will probably record and republish it. Or is there a way to ENSURE (with zero knowledge proof?) that sound is not recorded? Probably not. Definately not. Stupid idea. Needs improvement.

# UTILITY FOR MYSELF

- **Interior Sketcher**: Online app to draw your room, then visualize it in 3D. You can import all furniture from Ikea by default. Questions to research: 1. Did really no one build this? 2- Why does Ikea not have it? 3. Am I the only one that wants to visualize the room (maybe there is no demand?)
- **Self Hosted Dropbox**: Buy your own server that you can run at home. Periodically can be backed up to a cloud hosting solution like google cloud or AWS, but the data is encrypted, such that your data is not usable without your encryption key. That way privacy is enabled, but you can still profit from robustness of big cloud providers without leaking and exposing your data and privacy.
- **Self Hosted Notion Alternative**: Build a notion alternative that works on a local folder structure on your local file system (and can be backed up with any cloud hosting provider like dropbox or google cloud, or your very own cloud).

- **MobRun**: For lonely joggers that try to find a community of runners in the area they run / Gamifying the jogging experience by trying to flock groups of people to jogg together. Connecting on the app through real time contact only. OR ANOTHER APPROACH: matches runners that run in the same area and similar pace with each other. Tinder for runners. Upload your data from runtastic or nike+ and get recommendations. Stats are most important.
- **mediumforcoders.com**: Simple clone of medium.com that supports codeblocks with syntax highlighting.
- **Only HTML CSS Form Creator Tool**: build the best too to create a form by only using HTML and CSS. Multiple layers, first pick layout and dimensions, then pick the components.

- **NFT Price Guesser**: Game that shows you an NFT and 3 opions what the current value of that NFT is, you can choose between 4 answers.
- **old games in the browser**: play old classic games in the browser, by porting the full game to WASM. Similar to: DOOM3 => http://www.continuation-labs.com/projects/d3wasm/. (NOTE: I really don't think this project would makes sense economically. Getting licences, then rewriting code just to serve on the web, for a small target audience. But fun for sure).

- **Autocomplete Showcase**: build a search autocomplete prediction website, that stores all queries that were run, and then updates bayes probabilities on queries to predict what most likely is going to be searched for, and then display those most likely queries to the user. Let the user "retrain" the model.

# TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT
- **SteerYourPcByGestures**: API to use hand gestures or audio commands to steer your computer. Build with lobe or teachable machine. MVP: for youtube? Maybe extension?
- **NFT Framework**: NFT token framework that lets people buy "stocks" of a private person (content creator) or band etc. The address holding the NFT token can then sign a message and get access to specials offered by that band. Usecase: a band sells 10 NFTs that allow the holder to always get into a live gig. A hype could build up whats the next big band and people could speculate on the future success of bands.
- **Holo Ghosts**: CryptoKitties clone on Holochain.

- **GoodAdvertise**: Advertising works by repetition. But the advertiser's interests are not aligned with the user being served the adds. Imagine what positive impact one could have when you would get advertisment for stuff that is actually beneficial to you instead of random stuff corporations want to sell you in order to maximize profits. Example: Imagine how exciting it would be to get adds that show how running or meditation is beneficial to your health. And you get those adds all the time. This would rewire your brain for new patterns and would truly benefit the person seeing the add. GoodAdvertise is a service that plays you randomly adds that you yourself create (shold be a google extension?)
- **Visualize your Values**: It's important to know yourself and be aware of your core values. To help become who you want to become, launch a tool that creates phone backgrounds that visualize your values in a beautiful way.

Similar to the idea of one guy that sold pixels on his website.
- **IamCryptoRich or BurnBitcoin**: build an app that allows bitcoin holders to burn bitcoin and get a proof of burn (rewarded with a cryptogrtaphical proof and maybe a badge or similar?
