# EXTENSIONS
- **Scam Comment Remover**: flags youtube comments of poeple having same name than the creator, because they are often impersonated.
- **Comment Wall**: browser extension that lets you post comments on any website. All comments are public and users can upvote/downvote comments. Think of it as a reddit thread for every single webpage. To consume content and for private notes you do not need to pay, but if you want to publically post stuff you need to pay a fee on 10$ to prevent bot armies.
- **JS runner**: browser extension that lets you run your own javascript. You can post your code with descriptiuon. For example: "avoid medium popups", or: "scrape instagram pictures" etc...

Imagine what positive impact one could have when you would get advertisment for stuff that is actually beneficial to you instead of random stuff corporations want to sell you in order to maximize profits. Example: Imagine how exciting it would be to get adds that show how running or meditation is beneficial to your health. And you get those adds all the time. This would rewire your brain for new patterns and would truly benefit the person seeing the add. GoodAdvertise is a service that plays you randomly adds that you yourself create (shold be a google extension?)
