Repo to brainstorm potential products to build as a challenge. Repo just cointains Notes.

## Ideas

- **TypeWriter App**: Keybr.com but with books and articles based (intead of random text) to learn to type faster
- **Bartender App**: lets you create, manage and share your cocktail recipes. For pasionate bartenders.
- **Launch Your Product**: Tool that aggregates all plattforms to promote a product launch (e.g. producthunt, sideproject.org and so on) and makes it easier to keep track of the process.
- **TrackYourLife**: Define custom goals and track their progression (habbit forming)
- **SwarmBrush**: Tool (maybe extension to photoshop) that lets you draw using swarm algorithms to enhace creativity
- **Encrypted Database**: Database service that lets you store your data. But we ensure that its encrypted. If you loose your keys, your data is not readible.
- **Free Version of Tetris**: Tetris experience (?) clone that copies the atmosphere. Playable on the browser for free. Controll with iphone?
- **Multiplayer Games**: webbrowser session -> lets people play with their phones! (tetris / asteroids / pong)
