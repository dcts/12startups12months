## Ideas

- **Bartender App**: lets you create, manage and share your cocktail recipes. For pasionate bartenders.
- **Launch Your Product**: Tool that aggregates all plattforms to promote a product launch (e.g. producthunt, sideproject.org and so on) and makes it easier to keep track of the process.
- **TrackYourLife**: Define custom goals and track their progression (habbit forming)
- **SwarmBrush**: Tool (maybe extension to photoshop) that lets you draw using swarm algorithms to enhace creativity
- **Encrypted Database**: Database service that lets you store your data. But we ensure that its encrypted. If you loose your keys, your data is not readible.
- **OpenSource Tetris Effect Clone**: With custom music from local artists (to have similar atmosphere). Playable in the browser for free. Controll with iphone or keyboard.
- **Multiplayer Games**: webbrowser session -> lets people play with their phones! (tetris / asteroids / pong)

- **ubuntu emoji picker electron app**: as sideproject. Is it possible to write a emoji picker that opens where the mouse is and writes the emoji to the clipboard?
- **ubuntu color picker**: same question as with the emoji picker. Can we write a native desktop app that accesses the screens information?
- **launch your idea tracker**: a tool that keeps track of all your projects that you launch and all plattform where to launch in one place. Also generate metrics for the projects to measure success. Maybe code first to use for all other projects?
