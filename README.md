Also generate metrics for the projects to measure success. Maybe code first to use for all other projects? Use the development cycle by 12 startups in 12 months guy

- **Holo Ghosts**: CryptoKitties clone on Holochain.
- **CalledItBtcPricePredictionBet**: Game to predict the next ATM of BTC. Designed as smart contract with oracle chainlink? small percentage of all locked up funds go to the developer (me).

# EXTENSIONS
- **Scam Comment Remover**: flags youtube comments of poeple having same name than the creator, because they are often impersonated.
- **Comment Wall**: browser extension that lets you post comments on any website. All comments are public and users can upvote/downvote comments. Think of it as a reddit thread for every single webpage. To consume content and for private notes you do not need to pay, but if you want to publically post stuff you need to pay a fee on 10$ to prevent bot armies.

- **GoodAdvertise**: Advertising works by repetition. But the advertiser's interests are not aligned with the user being served the adds. Imagine what positive impact one could have when you would get advertisment for stuff that is actually beneficial to you instead of random stuff corporations want to sell you in order to maximize profits. Example: Imagine how exciting it would be to get adds that show how running or meditation is beneficial to your health. And you get those adds all the time. This would rewire your brain for new patterns and would truly benefit the person seeing the add. GoodAdvertise is a service that plays you randomly adds that you yourself create (shold be a google extension?)
- **Visualize your Values**: It's important to know yourself and be aware of your core values. To help become who you want to become, launch a tool that creates phone backgrounds that visualize your values in a beautiful way. That way you keep reminded about your inner core every day, and hopefully, help you strive for what you aim for. Similar that the **GoodAdvertise** idea
